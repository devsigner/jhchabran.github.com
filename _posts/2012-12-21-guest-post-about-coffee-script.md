CoffeeScript is now four years old and had been introduced into 
Rails 3 default stack in april 2011. Yet CoffeeScript isn't well known
among the gigantic community of web developers! 

So as friends of mine are running [a generalist blog about development and
security](http://devquotes.com), I took the opportunity of introducing
CoffeeScript there to their heterogeneous audience.

I wrote a [guest post there, introducing CoffeeScript](http://www.devquotes.com/2012/12/15/coffeescript-javascript-like-a-sir/) with a quick overview, stressing as it should be
the fact that CoffeeScript is a drop in replacement for Javascript, not
a costful technology change.

CoffeeScript is a rare bird, web developers from any language and
framework can benefit from it, I wonder how its usage will grow in 2013.
