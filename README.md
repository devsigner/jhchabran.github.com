# Website and blog

Hi, this is my website and my blog, powered by Jekyll and bootstrap.

Blogging is hard and I'm not a native english speaker, I'm really trying to improve myself here.
That means you might find typos and grammar mistakes so I'd be very grateful if you correct me on anything, being a typo, a weird sentence or an error about what I'm blogging.

You can help me to improve by pinging me on Twitter (@jhchabran), opening a Github issue or by making a Pull Request.
